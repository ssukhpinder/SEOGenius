Imagine crafting titles so SEO-friendly that Google sends you a personal thank-you note 😂

## Introduction

Crafts SEO-friendly titles, subtitles, summaries, TLDRs, and hashtags for online content.

I was looking for some free tools to generate SEO titles, subtitles, summaries, TLDRs, and hashtags for online content. I know some of you will think even ChatGPT can do that, but here are the problems where I lose productivity or face issues.

### Problems Faced:

* ChatGPT or any other tool doesn’t provide the effectiveness score

* Specially ChatGPT shows the hashtags in bullet points which is tough to align on social platforms.

### How SEOGenius does this better

I have trained [SEOGenius](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-SqJs3feKL-seogenius) to comprehensively tackle the issues mentioned above.

* It provides multiple SEO-friendly titles with their effectiveness score.

* Users can easily copy hashtags. I know some users will think you can ask ChatGPT to show in one line. True, you can do that but [SEOGenius](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-SqJs3feKL-seogenius)does that by default as shown below
